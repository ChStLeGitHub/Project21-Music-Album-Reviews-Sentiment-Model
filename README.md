# Music Album Reviews Sentiment Model
 
**The Task:**

The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of written music album reviews as either positive or negative. 

After the final model is selected, there is a write-up detailing some potential weaknesses of the model and/or ways the model could be improved.

(Note that the specific names of the albums being reviewed are irrelevant to the problem.)

**The Data:**

The dataset comprises of approximately 80,000 music album reviews and contains two columns: the texts of the reviews and the numeric ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5. 

A review is classified as positive if its rating exceeds 2.5, and the goal is to achieve a minimum accuracy score of 90% in determining the sentiment of each review.
